## Getting Started: Quickstart Guide

Follow these steps to get the project running locally without configuring a local Python environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <YOUR_GITLAB_REPO_URL>
cd cpc-ai-waste-classification-system
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy the template configuration file to create your local `.env` file.

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

**Mac / Linux / Git Bash:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file in your text editor and add your OpenAI API key and project secrets:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

### 3. Build and Start the Application
Run Docker Compose to build the image and launch the web server:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal, or run:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Development Workflow & Subsystems

This project is divided into four modular subsystems:

* **User Creation & Management** (`app/subsystems/auth/`)
* **Waste Identification & Classification** (`app/subsystems/classification/`)
* **Educational Chatbot** (`app/subsystems/chatbot/`)
* **Statistical Dashboard** (`app/subsystems/dashboard/`)

---

## Branching Guidelines

* **Do not** commit directly to `main`.
* **Branch naming convention:** `feature/<subsystem>/<feature>` (e.g., `feature/educational/chatbot`).
* Once your task is complete and tested, push your branch and create a Merge Request (MR) on GitLab for review.
